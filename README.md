<h2>What is Pomofocus?</h2>
<p>Pomofocus is a customizable pomodoro timer that works on desktop & mobile browser. The aim of this app is to help you focus on any task you are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. This app is inspired by <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pomodoro Technique</a> which is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo.</p>

<h2>What is Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
<p>The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikipedia</a></p>
